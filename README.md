# spotifyClone
## This is the my 1st ever web project made with pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
### Since it was my 1st work as a noob coder, i couldn't write clean code + I made this on my phone. Yes, the entire app was programed on my phone & i had no idea about responsive design, that's why it'll look & feel normal on any phone screen but will start acting weird on bigger screens such as laptop/desktop.
